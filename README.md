# Project-J 🚀  
Local AI with Ollama and Qwen2  

## 📌 Overview  
Project-J is a simple setup to run a **Large Language Model (LLM)** locally on your system using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/).  
Instead of relying on cloud-based AI, this project lets you experiment with running models **offline** for learning and development.  

## 🧠 Model File  
The model file (`.gguf`) is too large to store directly in the repo, so it’s uploaded as an **Asset** under [Releases](../../releases).  
Think of it as the **AI’s brain** — the repo holds the code, and the `.gguf` file gives the model its knowledge.  

- Model: **Qwen2**  
- File format: **GGUF** (optimized for local inference)  
- Release: [Qwen2 Model Release, model-v1](../../releases/tag/model-v1)

## ⚡ Getting Started  
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download).  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak11085/Project-J.git
   cd Project-J
Download the .gguf model file from the release page and place it in your working directory.

Run the app:

bash
Copy code
python main file.py
📝 Notes
The .gguf file is large, so it’s hosted in releases instead of the repo.

This project is meant for learning & experimentation with local AI.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

Made with ❤️ for learning how to run AI locally.
